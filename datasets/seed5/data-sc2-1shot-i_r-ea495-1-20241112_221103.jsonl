Instead, use bit manipulation to achieve the result.

Otherwise, this approach inherently computes the floor of the division. To adjust for the ceiling without directly calculating it, we can consider two cases:\n\n1. If `n` is divisible by `2**b`, the result of the division is simply the value of right-shifting `n` by `b` bits.\n2. Otherwise, we need to increment the right-shifted result by 1 to achieve the ceiling effect.\n\nTo determine the divisibility of `n` by `2**b`, we can check if the first `b` bits of `n` are all 0. This can be done using a mask with the first `b` bits set to 1, and then performing a bitwise AND operation with `n`. If the result is 0, it indicates that `n` is divisible by `2**b`.

After delivering your response, verify its consistency and correctness by writing a series of executable tests.\n\n## Example 1\n<instruction>\nDesign a Python function that takes a sorted array and a target value, and return a valid index where target can be inserted to maintain the array's sorted order. Optimize the function to run in logarithmic time complexity.\n\nFor example, given `array = [1, 3, 5, 5, 6]` and `target = 5`, the function should return either 2 or 3 because 5 presents at both indices 2 and 3.\n</instruction>\n\n<response>\nTo solve this problem efficiently and ensure logarithmic time complexity, we can use a binary search algorithm. Compared with a standard binary search that looks for an exact match, we can modify the algorithm such that when the target is not found, we return the `left` bound, which represents the index where the target can be inserted to maintain the array's sorted order. Since any valid index for insertion is acceptable, we can direclty return the index if there is an exact match.\n\nHere is a Python function that implements this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef search_insert_position(nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the index to insert `target` into `nums` to maintain sorted order. For example,\n    given `nums = [1, 3, 5, 5, 6]` and `target = 5`, this function returns either 2 or 3,\n    as `target` can be inserted at index 2 or 3 to maintain the sorted order.\n    \"\"\"\n    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if nums[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        elif nums[mid] < target:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid - 1\n    return left\n```\n\nThis implementation ensures that when `target` is not found, `left` represents the correct insertion index. This is because at the end of the loop, all elements to the left of `left` are smaller than `target`, all elements to the right of `left` are equal to or larger than `target`, and `left > right`. Therefore, `left` is the correct index for insertion to maintain the sorted order.\n</response>\n\n<tests>\nYou can test the function with scenarios where the target is found at multiple indices and where the target is not present in the array:\n\n```python\nassert search_insert_position([1, 3, 5, 5, 6], 5) in [2, 3]\nassert search_insert_position([1, 3, 5, 5, 6], 2) == 1\nassert search_insert_position([1, 3, 5, 5, 6], 7) == 5\nassert search_insert_position([1, 3, 5, 5, 6], 0) == 0\n```\n</tests>\n\n## Example 2\n<instruction>\nWrite a Python function that takes a dictionary as an input and prints out all pairs of keys and values, separated by a colon.

After delivering your response, verify its consistency and correctness by writing a series of executable tests.\n\n## Example 1\n<instruction>\nDesign a Python function that takes a sorted array and a target value, and return a valid index where target can be inserted to maintain the array's sorted order. Optimize the function to run in logarithmic time complexity.\n\nFor example, given `array = [1, 3, 5, 5, 6]` and `target = 5`, the function should return either 2 or 3 because 5 presents at both indices 2 and 3.\n</instruction>\n\n<response>\nTo solve this problem efficiently and ensure logarithmic time complexity, we can use a binary search algorithm. Compared with a standard binary search that looks for an exact match, we can modify the algorithm such that when the target is not found, we return the `left` bound, which represents the index where the target can be inserted to maintain the array's sorted order. Since any valid index for insertion is acceptable, we can direclty return the index if there is an exact match.\n\nHere is a Python function that implements this approach:\n\n```python\nfrom typing import List\n\ndef search_insert_position(nums: List[int], target: int) -> int:\n    \"\"\"\n    Finds the index to insert `target` into `nums` to maintain sorted order. For example,\n    given `nums = [1, 3, 5, 5, 6]` and `target = 5`, this function returns either 2 or 3,\n    as `target` can be inserted at index 2 or 3 to maintain the sorted order.\n    \"\"\"\n    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1\n    while left <= right:\n        mid = (left + right) // 2\n        if nums[mid] == target:\n            return mid\n        elif nums[mid] < target:\n            left = mid + 1\n        else:\n            right = mid - 1\n    return left\n```\n\nThis implementation ensures that when `target` is not found, `left` represents the correct insertion index. This is because at the end of the loop, all elements to the left of `left` are smaller than `target`, all elements to the right of `left` are equal to or larger than `target`, and `left > right`. Therefore, `left` is the correct index for insertion to maintain the sorted order.\n</response>\n\n<tests>\nYou can test the function with scenarios where the target is found at multiple indices and where the target is not present in the array:\n\n```python\nassert search_insert_position([1, 3, 5, 5, 6], 5) in [2, 3]\nassert search_insert_position([1, 3, 5, 5, 6], 2) == 1\nassert search_insert_position([1, 3, 5, 5, 6], 7) == 5\nassert search_insert_position([1, 3, 5, 5, 6], 0) == 0\n```\n</tests>\n\n## Example 2\n<instruction>\nWrite a Python program to load two CSV files and merge them into one data frame.
